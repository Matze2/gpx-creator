Generate a GPX which can be imported into c:geo.
One use case is to be able to create a PMO cache entry in c:geo without being a PM if you have access to the cache coordinates at least (e.g. though a PM friend).
The rest of the information (cache name, type and size, D/T rating, owner) can be retrieved from geocaching.com.
